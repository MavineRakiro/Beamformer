#BEAMFORMER.
This is a project submitted by Mavine Rakiro and Ivy Njeri as their final year project. The objective was To achieve the highest data rates and best Quality of Service for intelligent transport systems by training mm-wave networks using long short-term memory neural network model and applying least mean square algorithm to predict vehicular motion and subsequent beam forming.
